# 👋 Hey, I’m Elis Cazacu

I’m a **Cloud Support and Automation Enthusiast** with a strong foundation in **Python, AWS, and IT Infrastructure**.  
Currently, I’m focused on building a solid path toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer**, combining automation, security, and scalability into everything I create.

I’ve always been driven by curiosity — whether it’s breaking down complex systems, learning how they connect, or finding ways to automate and optimize them.  
Over the past year, I’ve gone from hands-on **IT Support** to completing multiple **cloud and development certifications**, while building **real, deployable projects** that demonstrate my technical growth.

## ☁️ What I Do

- Design and build small-scale **cloud-integrated Python applications** (like my [Cloud Budget Tracker](https://github.com/Elis420/cloud-budget-tracker))  
- Work with **AWS services** such as S3, Lambda, and CloudShell for automation and serverless workflows  
- Manage systems, troubleshoot network and infrastructure issues, and write tools to make repetitive tasks faster and smarter  
- Continuously learn and document my projects on this blog — from **scientific computing** to **cloud automation**

---

## 🧩 Skills & Technologies

**Cloud:** AWS (S3, Lambda, CloudShell, IAM, EC2)  
**Programming:** Python (boto3, automation, data handling)  
**Systems:** Linux (Omarchy, Ubuntu), Windows Server  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, VirtualBox, CLI, Bash, PowerShell  
**Certifications:**  
- Google IT Support Professional  
- freeCodeCamp – Scientific Computing with Python  
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

## 💡 What Drives Me

I love turning ideas into working cloud applications — things that actually solve a problem, automate a workflow, or help people understand technology better.  
I approach learning with speed, structure, and deep curiosity — often mastering new topics in days instead of weeks.  

Whether it’s deploying Python scripts on AWS, exploring serverless automation, or writing about my experiences, I aim to stay adaptable in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Transition fully into a **Cloud Engineering or DevOps** role in the near future  
- Keep building practical cloud-based tools using Python  
- Contribute to open-source and mentor others transitioning into tech  
- Long-term: launch a **cloud automation startup**, blending my technical skills with creativity and business insight  

---

## 🌍 Outside of Work

When I’m not experimenting with cloud deployments, I enjoy:  
- Working out and staying physically disciplined 💪  
- Reading the Bible and reflecting on purpose and balance ✨  
- Exploring new Linux distributions (currently using **Omarchy**) 🐧  
- Learning from successful tech entrepreneurs and engineers who built their careers from scratch
